I bought the new iphone two months ago and it is a piece of garbage. I cannot reach the whole screan and I do not see why anyone would need such a big device. For how much Im spending it might aswell be able to not break when it falls five feet. The paper thin case does nothing. Today I learned rock beats paper when I dropped the device from my pocket while jogging, and it shattered on the sidewalk. If only I could return it but I cannot. Terrible device DO NOT BUY.
