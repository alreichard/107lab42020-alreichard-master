"I've had this for about 8 months now. And in those 8 months I've switched back and forth from this remote, and the tiny remote it came with. I lost the tiny remote behind my bed 2 months ago and since I'm lazy, it's still down there. So I've had to rely on the game controller for everything (sad face).And that's not a good thing.....battery life is laughable. This controller is never farther than 7 feet from the box and yet, 9/10 I ALWAYS GET THE ANNOYING LOADING/CONNECTING DOTS.This cost 60. And for that amount of money, It should be CONNECTING to a box that's 7 FEET AWAY.damn you amazon, I still love you tho.",Doesn't respond to FireTV
