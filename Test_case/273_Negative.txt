"I bought this case at the same time I bought a new Fire tablet during Prime days. It was recommended on the tablet page, so I thought I was getting the right case. Well, it doesn't fit - not by a long shot. Then I realized the case was for a new Fire for 2017 (like mine) but 7th generation, not 8th. Since it does not fit, I now have to return it. And at my expense (arg!) I can't even exchange it for a new one because apparently Amazon does not make this case for the 8th generation Fire yet. You update one of your products, then release it, but you don't put out a case for it at the same time WTH Amazon When will you start selling Amazon cases for the Amazon Fire 8th generation I'm NOT happy with Amazon right now and am wondering whether I should keep the tablet if I can't get a case for it that has the vertical stand feature that the Amazon case has.",It was recommended on the tablet page
