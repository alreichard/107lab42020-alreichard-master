"Excellent, my daughter loves this. She can read books, do her school work, watch a few shows, and listen to music. She really enjoys having something that is just for her to use. She is 12 and this was the perfect age appropriate gift that is also extremely functional. I do use the parent settings for some extra security when she is using it unsupervised but otherwise, I do not have a set time limit. Great product.",Great gift for 12yr old girl
