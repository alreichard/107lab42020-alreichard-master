"oh my effing word. this has better sound than my hp laptop. with one of the standing cases, you can turn it into a kitchen tv by laying the flap on the bottom shelf of a cabinet above your counter, and then placing a can of something on the flap to make sure it stays there. gently close the cabinet door, and it stays there hanging down so you can watch something while you prepare dinner. the standing cases work, but I don't want my kindle on the counter top near any possibly splashing liquids, so I started doing the hanging thing. I say screw normality and lets do things a different way...",fire in the kitchen
