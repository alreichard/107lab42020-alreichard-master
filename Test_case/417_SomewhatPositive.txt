"I've been an iPad user since the original came out. I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not 500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the 200 price tag. I might pay the 15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me.Read more","You Get What You Pay For 31,"
