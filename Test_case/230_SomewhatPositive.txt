"It seems to work fine so far (2 Days with it). What I don't like is how Amazon has made it so thePrime content is mixed with the For Pay content, with no easy way to just see what is ONLY Prime content. This is obviously made to divert you into buying more non Prime content...Amazon, please give us a CLEAR way to view Prime Only if that's what we want. I know we can voice search for anything... and that's great, but sometimes we just want to Go Fishing and would like to fish in the Prime pond only. This is a pretty big deal when you compare this to competing (Think ROKU) products that let you do just that.Hard to believe your competition does a better job with presenting your own content than you do. Maybe an update in the near future will Fix this.",I like it Amazon...But this is IMPORTANT
