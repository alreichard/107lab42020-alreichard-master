"Here goes, I'm the 9 thousandth reviewer for this product LOL. short preface: I love Amazon, so when comparing all streaming devices in the end I went with the Fire TV because of the outstanding customer service, and it will improve with time. That being said, I share the frustrations that all my fellow buyers have: I hate not being able to sort out the non Prime videos, I truly dislike paying for an episode (I didn't see that one coming, even though I did a ton of research). But overall I love my new cable bill, which only includes internet and basic, and I mean basic, service (15.00) because I'm reserving the right to order HBO and Showtime at some point. Was massively disappointed in Hulu Plus, because they don't offer the entire series in a show anymore (did they run out of server space or what) Netflix was a pleasant surprise. In case you are wondering, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Prime are your alternatives to paying your cable bill. And streaming is quite alright...after you get over the initial shock of not having live TV, although, ABC does do live TV hope the other stations follow suit soon. Overall, as a non tech person, it was ridiculously easy to hook this up, really anyone can do it. And like I said, if you're comparing other products, in the end Amazon cannot be beat for customer service or support.",Superior Amazon Customer Service Support was the deciding factor for me....
