"I am sooo impressed with Amazon Fire TV. Believe it or not, I sit and watch the screensaver lots a lot because the pictures are just that good. It is like taking a trip around the world. The amount of things you can do with this Fire TV is pretty incredible to me. There is so much on here and that can be added as apps is impressive. There is a massive amount of things to watch, both free with Prime and much that is a fee to rent or buy. I am glad I made this purchase. This unit is so small I will take it with me on vacation and just plug it in to any TV with the HDMI and keep up with my favorite shows.",Small and yet sooo big.
