"I would have rated this higher (4 stars) but I am taking off 2 stars for not having an 'off' or a 'sleep mode' button. It is supposed to go to sleep after 30 minutes but mine has not gone to sleep much since plugging it in a few days ago. So far it is only a slight improvement over my LG blu-ray players which allows me to watch amazon videos. I only see a few Interesting games so I will continue using my Xbox and my Kindle tablets until more games are available. For the price, I could have waited.",No Off Button
