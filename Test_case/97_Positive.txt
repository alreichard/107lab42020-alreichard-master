"This integrated perfectly with our fire tv stick, and was a great surprise for the gamers in the family. It works great with the fire stick, and does not negate the other remote, giving us two remote options. It even has a headphone jack, making it so my husband can watch tv shows with bad language while the kids are in the room. This is a great addition.",and was a great surprise for the gamers in the family One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No
