"I feel like a lot of the bad reviews are from people who do not know what they are doing, or don't fully understand how to use the tablet to its full potential. This tablet DOES allow you download any app that you would find on the play store! Because of the parental features you have to first download them on YOUR PARENT PROFILE FIRST!! I love that about this tablet. Also, I can block the camera AND web browser so my child can't access that either! I can put a pass code on pretty much everything like profiles, WiFi access, settings, etc. It's really easy to set up and it came almost fully charged so I had plenty of time download what I wanted for my daughter and set it all up before I had to put it on the charger... It does, however, take a bit long to complete charge to 100, but no big deal. This is a great tablet so far and we are thoroughly enjoying it :)",YES you CAN download apps like KidsYou Tube!
