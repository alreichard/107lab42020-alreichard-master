"This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra.","Awesome, smart little portable speaker"
