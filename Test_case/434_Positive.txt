"Much improved screen!It turns out that the 49.95 Fire 7 version released two years ago didn't have an IPS screen.Now it does.Technically, both the old one and this new one are just 171 ppi (pixels per inch) but this one seems much crisper than the first generation 49-er.My eyes don't lie. IPS makes the screen a lot crisper!There's also a stunning improvement in color quality with the new screen. Now it holds its own with the 62 color gamut original iPad Mini before, it wasn't anywhere near.Mind you it's not current Apple screen quality, or current high-end Samsung screen quality - but what is It's only 49.95, and it's good enough. Heck, at 49.95, its MORE than good enough, it's great. It blows away just about any entry level consumer laptop screen, that's for sure.I pulled out my 2015 first-gen, 49.95 Fire 7 - the one this replaces - and placed it side by side with this new one. The colors (including a horrific green tint on white backgrounds) on the old one weren't video-worthy - ok for casual videos on Facebook and YouTube, maybe, but not good enough for Netflixing and Amazon Prime.This new one, though It's movie-worthy, especially with earphones (ok, ONLY with earphones). I'd prefer 720p over the Fire 7's 600p (600p is better than 480p DVD's, but not ask good as even entry-level - 720p - HDTV quality), but overall even at 600p it's eminently watchable.By the way, for me streaming video content on Amazon Prime Instant Video has been noticeably sharper than streaming YouTube. I think Amazon Prime adapts to 600p (max for this tablet) while YouTube is is probably delivering only 480p (remember YouTube's defaults are 360p/480p/720p and up).Read more",IPS screen makes all the difference in the world still no Google app compatibility
