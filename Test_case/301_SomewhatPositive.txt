"I've had the new Fire HD 8 with the case for about a week. I use it exclusively for reading and listening to audiobooks. So far my only issue with the tablet is the volume drops when the cover is closed. Why is that There is no reason I can think of why my volume needs should change because I closed the lid. BTW, the marine blue is lovely. The speakers are located along the left side of the device so when you close the table case the sound quality which is already mediocre, is noticeably diminished. This is a design flaw that needs to be fixed. I purchased this tablet to replace an impaired ipad mini. For the price, the Fire tablet is a reasonable replacement.",Just fine
