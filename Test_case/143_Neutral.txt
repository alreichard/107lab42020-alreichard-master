"I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and TV all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen.The problem with displaying the show on a kitchen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on if you have a larger kitchen, so if you aren't standing directly in front of it, it's hard to view the screen. You will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you.As far as I can tell you can not cut the screen off completely, which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom. The clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen. *Update* The screen can be cut off.This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients.Read more",Maybe I was expecting more...
