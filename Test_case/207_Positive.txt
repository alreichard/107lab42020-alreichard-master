"Wasn't sure how this would work with my rural DSL but it is WONDERFUL. I haven't had any problems with it at all. It is easy to use and the voice command works just as they said it would. So very, very glad I bought it. Loads of stuff to watch. I have been able to catch up with some series I have missed, especially the BBC ones that I dearly love. I recommend it to anyone who likes variety in what they can watch. Along with my Amazon Prime most everything is FREE..that is an added bonus. Try it, you'll like it.",So glad I gave this a try...
