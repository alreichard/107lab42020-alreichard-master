"This is my 4th Kindle Fire, I also have the first generation, an 8.9 HDX and the new 6. The first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is, despite being the largest Fire to date. I love the more narrow, widescreen design of the screen, perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode. Anyway, before I get carried away gushing, Ill just list my pros and one or two cons, to make this easier to read and save time.PROS:Wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books.The stereo speakers sound incredible, even better than the previous HDX modelFor comic book readers comics purchased from Amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from Comixology. I was wondering when Amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics, finally!Battery life seems to be similar to my 8.9 HDX, but Im happy with that considering the larger screen and thinness of the device.Considerably faster response time across the board.Finally! We can add a micro SD card to expand storage capacity! Yay!The camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous FireCONS:Would have preferred a rubberized back and case. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also.Still deciding on the new software layout, maybe its because Im so familiar with the old Fire OS, but lets just say Im not blown away be the design so far.","Keeps Getting Better, Especially for Comic Readers 2,"
