"Note: My original Kindle Oasis review was posted on 4/29/16 on this product page on Amazon: New - Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover. This page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the U.S. My original review follows.UPDATE 7/24/16: After using my Oasis for almost 3 months, I thought I would add a brief comment to my original review. I have settled on using the Oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and I prefer the page turn button style. For my reading elsewhere, for example if I want to read while eating, I use my Voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. I can read the same book using both Kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. The Voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the Oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. I have to say that I'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model Kindle that I recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. My original review follows.---------Amazon released the first Kindle in November of 2007. Eight and a half years later, the Oasis model is the 8th generation Kindle and the third evolution of Kindle with built-in illumination. The price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but I ordered mine as soon as it was announced on April 13th.Read more",Ive loved both my Paperwhite and Voyage is the Oasis worth the additional cost
