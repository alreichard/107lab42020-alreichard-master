"An Amazon.com official commented on this review(What's this) The Amazon team saysOctober 11, 2013Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound, and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD. As you correctly point out, the new Kindle Fire HD is the successor to last year's entry level Kindle Fire, which does not include features such as camera, microphone, or HDMI port. You are also correct to point out that this device does not support Mayday, although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device. We hope you enjoy the new features and services. Thanks, The Kindle Team","Decent, inexpensive, entry-level tablet 5,942 people found this helpful.
