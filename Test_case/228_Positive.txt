"In addition to the Fire TV, I have an Apple TV as well as a ChromeCast. By far and large, the best product is the Fire TV. I use it more than both the other ones combined. Having integration between my Prime list and the device is clutch, as I consume media across several different devices.I do wish I could search by Prime Instant, so I hope they will fix that. I also wish I could cast a Prime Instant streaming video from a device to the Fire TV, but I don't see that as an option (although I can cast YouTube to my Fire TV, which is really cool).There is no doubt that it is faster than both Apple TV and ChromeCast, and the voice recognition is SO convenient. I also have the game controller, and the games are pretty good. I don't game much, but I wanted to check it out. I was surprised at the speed of the games and the level of engagement.I'd also like to be able to see a future improvement where screens can be mirrored from devices to this (both ChromeCast and Apple TV have this). From an educator's standpoint, this could be the 100 solution to wireless projection for classroom teachers (Apple TV doesn't play well with enterprise level security, and ChromeCast doesn't do well with some software that is essential for instruction).All in all, it's my favorite media device. It's faster, has a great and snappy UI, and is easy to setup.",Fire TV (Apple TV + ChromeCast)
