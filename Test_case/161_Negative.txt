"Bought a refurbished kindle and literally after one month of owning it the device started to freeze. I had to reboot it multiple times and then it would start working. Went on a trip and it worked as it should but as soon as I returned the battery died and I charged it over night and the next morning the screen was frozen with the character reading a book under a tree. I tried all rebooting methods (20 seconds, 40 seconds, 1 minute) and nothing. Called customer service and was on the phone for an hour. Eventually they said that they could only give me 35 off the next purchase of a new kindle. I was pretty bummed out that a refurbished product of their own was not backed by them. I ended up buying a new kindle with the discount they gave me but should have just went with a new one to begin with since I ended up spending the same amount of money and had way more of a headache to deal with. Now I have to figure out what to do with this new Kindle Paper Weight that I have.",I was pretty bummed out that a refurbished product of their own ...
