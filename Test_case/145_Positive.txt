"I waited two days to set up Show to give myself a reward for working. I read the majority of the reviews already posted. I have no idea why there is even a one-star review.Setup was a breeze. My Ring Pro screen pops up brilliantly. Nest cameras, too. Played Adele at the maximum volume and sang along with the lyrics Show trickled on the screen.As far as those who boo hoo over the headlines Show displays, you can give her the voice command of DND. Problem solved. Then, just tell her to wake up.I followed the simple instructions on how to change the generic photo on Show's home screen. Easy peasy.Granted, I haven't made a video call yet. Waiting for my folks to get in the game and buy Show.I'm not a lover of all things Amazon. I bought the newest Fire Tablet but returned it after a week. Show redeemed Amazon.If yours isn't working, you either got a dud or you're not doing something right.",Yeehaw
