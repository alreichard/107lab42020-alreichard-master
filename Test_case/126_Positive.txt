"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa.",The Extra Touch
