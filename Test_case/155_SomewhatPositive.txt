"I have now owned 4 Kindles and just love them! My first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse. I had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank. I then got 2 Kindle Fires. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other. I have had no problem with the Fire once I broke down and read some of the direction, if all else fails. Other than operator error I have used it for over a year but it's too heavy for my old overused hands. Not heavy though. Books now give me problems. Even paperbacks. But I then bought the smaller, lighter new Kindle and loved it from the first. I carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months. I called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one. This time I bought a light weight cover for it. I don't like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it I have to protect it. I have had this one for months and have had no problems. I now have about 600 books awaiting my pleasure! I just looked the Kindles over again. I'm getting paranoid about my little Kindle and am considering having an on site backup although Amazon would get me one here in just a couple of days. Still giving it thought. Basically I love my Kindles and use both of my current ones for different apps.",Love my Kindles!
