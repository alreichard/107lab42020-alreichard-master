"This is quite the steal! As already pointed out, the total value is 144.97. At the 99.99 price, this is a great deal. I was able to use the recent Prime 30 off offer to get this for 69.99. I bought this to have a Kindle to keep in my bag. My regular Kindle is the Voyage, but I've owned several other Kindles (K3 to Oasis). I compared the two screens with the same setup and the only thing I noticed is that the curve of the letters is sharper on the Voyage, but that was expected. Does it have a frontlight No... but as long as you know what to expect, you shouldn't be surprised. :) No light, no buttons but it also isn't advertised to have those features.",Quite the steal!
