"I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. But, keep in mind that this is not an iPad or typical Android tablet. This is an Amazon media and shopping machine. It is well built, has good battery life, reasonably fast and responsive, dual band wifi, SD card slot, decent display and so-so camera. No tablet is going to give you awesome sound, but I was surprised at how well the two speakers sound on this tablet. No tablet it going to give you a great camera, and this tablet is probably on the lower end of the spectrum - it works, but it won't be your go-to camera for important shots. This tablet excels at playing Amazon content - music and video. It is a great reader, although a little heavy compared to a Kindle device. It makes shopping easy - perhaps too easy. The OS is based on Android, but don't look for Google Play or Google apps in general - this is nothing like an Android tablet. Finally, you can't beat the price. I think Amazon wants to get these in the hands of as many people as possible. I would have given this 4.5 stars if that option was available. I didn't give it 5 stars only because it is not a general purpose tablet. This is a dramatic improvement over the Fire 7. The integration of Alexa is flawless and works very well - depends on whether or not you have an Echo and on how you feel about that product. I have an Echo and find it useful (not essential but useful). I find myself using Alexia on this tablet more than I thought I would.","I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised."
