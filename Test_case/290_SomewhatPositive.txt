"This is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new 8 inch 2017 Kindle Fire. Inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your Kindle into. The frame solidly holds your Kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops. The case weighs in at 4.66 ounces.The exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish. It is available in canary yellow, charcoal black, cobalt blue, marine blue and punch red. The one in my video is marine blue. The top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened.The cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover. I like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power. The inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed.I like that the micro SD card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case. That helps to protect the SD card from being lost or quickly stolen. A large memory size SD card can cost 47 to almost 100 and the added security is helpful.The tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video. I show this in my product video. All of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case. That includes the volume controls, the headphone jack, the microphone, the power charging port and the power on/off button.The cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading, browsing the Internet or watching movies.Read more",A nice case that works well to protect your tablet!
