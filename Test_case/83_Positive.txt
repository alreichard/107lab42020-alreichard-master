"Not that Amazon needs another 5 star review for this remote, but damn. This is a great remote. We don't have and never will have a game console in my house. My 4 year old and I have a blast playing Crossy Road and Shark Evolution on our big screen TV with this remote. Super great. Glad I bought it.",Makes games fun.
