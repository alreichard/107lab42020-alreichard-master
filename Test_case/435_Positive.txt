"Writing for the person it was bought for. she loves Loves LOVES it. her life has become very limited and this has really helped. The fact that she can ask Alexa for the news or weather is just wonderful. And she loves scrabble and solitaire. They are a little difficult to navigate for her but she persists, and does it. It just takes her a lot longer. The voice app in the Fire Messenger is very difficult for her to manage, the button is so tiny, and crammed up against the other things, It would be nice if someone would make HC friendly apps.*Note to Amazon Fire Designers*I would ask that you convince DRAGON to make a version of their Voice to Text app for the Fire, THEN she could enjoy things like FB. As it is all she can do is look, typing is way too difficult.",Parkinson's Disabled and LOVES it!
