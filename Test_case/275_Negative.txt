"Horrible cover for my new (third) Kindle!!! And it seems to be the only option for the Kindle Fire 7 (cover fits 7th generation). The back side of this cover folds like origami paper. It bends too many ways, is too lightweight, and won't prop up or stay propped up well. You can't stand it up to read on a table with any reliability. Forget it in a real wind or if it gets bumped.Amazon should have given us a choice between a sturdy cover with strong sides that don't bend all over and another, cuter, flimsier cover that can be bent as desired, like this one.Maggie",Flimsy Unstable Cover. Don't buy it.
