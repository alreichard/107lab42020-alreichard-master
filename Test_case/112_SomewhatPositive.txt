"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more",Updated review (after 2 months)...
