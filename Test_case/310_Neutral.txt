"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the Fire HD 8 from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation). Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon removed the Fire HD7, the Fire HDX7 and the Fire HDX8.9 and replaced them with the Fire HD (7 screen), Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.HARDWARE:WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: The HD8 Fire, a short USB cord and a power adapter. Finally, Amazon ships a power adapter with their Fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box. (Picture attached)SIZE: The HD8 is longer than the older HD7 but the same width as the discontinued HD7. It is also thinner. (8.4x5.0x0.3 versus 7.5x5.0x0.4). I have large hands and can hold it with one hand, but even with my hands, I really need to use both hands. Because it is longer, it seem top heavy to me. The back is also slick and slippery to hold. Mine has a habit of sliding off the table.Display: The resolution of the screen is 1280 x 800 same as the HD 7 but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length. In practical use, though, you can't tell the difference. The display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight. One nice touch is that now, you can choose your own wallpaper! It comes with 9 stock images and if you don't like one of them, you can choose your own image in your Amazon Photos folder.Read more","Disappointed First Impressions 1,"
