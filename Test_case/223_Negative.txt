"I already have 2 Roku devices, but thought I would give this new Amazon device a try. This device works fine for the Amazon Instant video app, but there is a terrible lag in the video on the Netflix app that makes it unusable on this device. I know this issue is not my internet connection as the Netflix app works great on the Roku devices. In addition, the user interface on this device is generally just not that great. Wish I could get a refund and get another roku box.",Device unusable for playing video on Netflix app
