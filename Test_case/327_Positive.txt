"So happy with my new fire and I wish I had bought more! Some of the PROS of this tablet are it has Alexa, Memory expansion slot, and a nice size. At 8 inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and Ebook . It is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids. The apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen. I install the Google Play store and Connect to the google play store to download apps is easy, like youtube. Without the Google Play store you will stuck with the Amazon store and apps.I often use the tablet to watch videos with my meidong E6 bluetooth headphones Meidong E6ANC Bluetooth Headphones Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Wireless Stereo headphones with Microphone, Ergonomic Design for Kids Adult-Black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for, this is right for you. And it has two colors for choice, black and rosegold,I have bought two. I did some research and found that the meidong company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth/ANC headphones, vibration speakers,wifi speakers. No wonder their headphones sound really nice, also recommend.Back to here,The only 1 CONS I would say about that The tablet has two camera, rear is 2mp and front is 0.3mp, very very basic. Having two speakers but the speaker is not great.Overall, it is a good value for the price,This tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do.","Great value for the price, I'm pleased"
