"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware. This means the 8.9 version is an enlarged version of the 7 version. For my 7 version review, please search for my HDX 7 review.My profile: Im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes. I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine. The HDX tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do. It is also my main electronic device, more important than my smartphones and laptopsI have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) Kindle HDX 7 which I also have a review you can check outAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year. For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added. It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Read more","An enlarged version of the 7 HDX - Same good internal components with a nicer screen- still a battery hog though 5,194 people found this helpful.
