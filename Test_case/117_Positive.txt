"If you're reading reviews of the new 3rd generation Paperwhite, you're likely considering buying one. If so, you're probably in one of these categories:* Never owned a Kindle e-ink reader* Own an older Kindle e-ink reader, but not a Paperwhite* Own a first or second generation PaperwhiteI'll save my opinion on whether the new Paperwhite 3 is worth buying until the end of my review. (But I will say this: They've taken a great product and made it even better.) First, here's a comparison of the new Paperwhite with the second generation Paperwhite (comparisons are for the wi-fi models):Second Generation Paperwhite (2013)-------------------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 212 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 6Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingAll-New Paperwhite (2015)------------------------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.2 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: TouchscreenNumber of fonts: 7Display lighting: Manually adjustable front-lightingNote that the physical size is identical to the older Paperwhite, so covers and sleeves that worked with the older Paperwhites are still usable (thank you, Amazon). The most obvious difference is the screen resolution: 300 pixels per inch is a major jump from the 212 pixels per inch in the older Paperwhites.Read more","A great product that's now even better 8,"
