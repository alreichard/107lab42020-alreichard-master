Have had this probably 3 weeks. Wanted to be fair with my review. The battery in my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it. Tried the Fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. Returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the Fire 10. Amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. The Fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. The apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. In the first three days it froze up 4 times. I wondered if it was doing this because I had too many apps opened. Once I started closing the apps I wasn't using I haven't had the tablet freeze problem. I do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. I also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by Amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary. Why Amazon stopped the 8.9 is beyond me but I'm doing ok now with the 10. If you get it give it some time.,Fire Ten OK
