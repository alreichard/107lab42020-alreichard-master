"Ok i've been in the technology field for close to 20 years and a gamer since the 80's so i know a little something about controllers. This really is an awesome controller with a great feel to it. It doesnt feel cheap in any way, and works perfect. It also has voice search button which works great and it has volume control via the shoulder buttons when headphones are plugged in. Ive read a few reviews about bad battery life and i havent found it an issue on mine. I bought it in late december and the batteries are due to be changed now in late april. I would like to see rechargable batteries built it instead but maybe in the future.",Great Controller
