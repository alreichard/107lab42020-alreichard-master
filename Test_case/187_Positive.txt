"Although I've owned almost every model of Kindle ebook readers since the 2nd generation Kindle that I bought in 2009, I had to think hard about ordering the new Voyage. I was very happy with my Paperwhite (the 2nd generation that was released in the fall of 2013), and as much as I wanted to try the Voyage, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend 199 on one. It became a moot point, though, when my wife ordered the Voyage, saying it was her early Christmas present to me. Now that I've had time to use the Voyage, I have to say I'm impressed. With hardware features like a 300 ppi display, LEDs that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting, and the user's choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages, the Voyage is hands down the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. At the end of my review, I'll give my opinion on whether it's worth upgrading from your current ebook reader.When I received the Voyage, the setup was quick (although you do have to go through a brief tutorial), and after downloading a few of my books from the Amazon Cloud and adjusting a few settings, the Voyage was ready to go. Here's a brief comparison of the Voyage and the Paperwhite:Voyage---------Size: 6.4x4.5x0.30Weight (wi-fi version): 6.3 ouncesDisplay: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, LED frontlitStorage memory: 4GBPage turns: Touchscreen plus PagePressDisplay lighting: Adaptive light sensor (automatic) plus manual adjustmentPaperwhite-------------Size: 6.7x4.6x0.36Weight (wi-fi version): 7.Read more","The state of the art e-ink reader but is it worth the money to upgrade 13,"
