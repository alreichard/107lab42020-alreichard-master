"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more",Provides Excellent protection for my new tap that is out and about with me as we speak!!!
