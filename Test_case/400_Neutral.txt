"I loved the concept of an ereader that would not be screen time. However, I have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior kindles I have owned. First, this product has no speaker of any kind, so it cannot play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones. A big loss - no current Kindle ereader can play audible books -- only older generation kindle ereaders or the Fire (which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time) - and sometimes, my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along. Second, it operates SLOWLY. Third, the Freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there. The categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore - e.g. mystery, biography, early chapter books, realistic fiction, series, etc - but an odd collection of categories - e.g. ballet, Frozen, Disney, Trucks, etc. Most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books I would want her to read. And there is no description of the book (like the blurb on the Amazon website) - so there is no way other than the title (and the unhelpful category) to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it. Finally, when I called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within Free time, and to put books from my Amazon account in the freetime library, I got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions (presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up) and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent.Read more",Loved the concept but execution falls short - and Customer Service was terrible!
