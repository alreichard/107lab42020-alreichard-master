"When I purchased my Kindle Fire HD 8, this was the recommended case at checkout. I purchased it thinking that an Amazon sourced cased should work and fit well. I'm very happy with my choice of this case both with its style/look and function. The price is much lower than that of the case in which I keep my Kindle Paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the Fire.To my match my black Kindle Fire, I chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweed style look in various shades of gray and black. It has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers I have used on my Paperwhite. The inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection. It does not have an internal pocket. My Kindle Fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case.The case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place. Whether the case is open or closed, the ports for charging, the MicroSD port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed. When it is closed, the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens. When the cover is fully open and folded to the back, the rear camera lens is covered (the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open.) If you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case, you can hold the front cover in your off-hand while it is in use.As I have a tendency to leave my Paperwhite on (and run down the battery fairly regularly), I appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it.",My Fire HD 8 fits securely in this attractive case
