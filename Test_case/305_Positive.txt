"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 8 Fire HD tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is nearly half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with the Amazon leather case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it. Notice how the speakers are visible at the top of the tablet when it is propped up in landscape mode.",An excellent choice for a good looking and durable case to protect Amazon's new Fire HD 8 tablet
