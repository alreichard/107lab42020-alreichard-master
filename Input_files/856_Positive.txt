"I bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from Bose and Beats. I purchased this one because it had great sound, but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via Alexa voice control. I love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice. It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear. If not in my library, it will play from Prime Music, similar to the way Apple Music functions. Additional voice features I use are news reports, weather forecasts, and control of WeMo switches in my home. Overall a great buy.",Great sound in a portable Bluetooth and more
