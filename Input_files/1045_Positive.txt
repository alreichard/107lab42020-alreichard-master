"I got this great little remote and then spent half a day trying to get it to work properly. I was about to box it up and send it back because it only understood what I was saying about 10 of the time. I thought it was defective. Then I actually read the instructions that came in the box with it and you have to HOLD the button down while you speak. It's not a push then talk type affair like I expected. Once I got that figured out, it works great. Glad I bought it because I use it quite a bit from the bedroom. This will hold me over until my Dot is shipped. FYI, it doesn't come with the cradle any more, at least mine didn't.","Works great, once you read the instructions!"
