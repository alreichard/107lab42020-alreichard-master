"I like Moshi's anti-glare screen protectors so much that the fact that there is one available for the Fire Phone is part of why I bought a Fire Phone. I've had these screen protectors on multiple iPads and iPod Touches over the years and they're the 1st thing I buy for any device I own (particularly those with shiny screens). I love that you don't have to worry about if you don't get them on right the first time, you can just pull them off and try again. I love that when they get dirty, you just remove it from the gadget and run it under water to clean it off and then put it back on your device.The Fire Phone does have a smaller bezel than the iPads and iPod Touches I've used with other Moshi anti-glare protectors, but there seems to be just enough that the protector stays on. (In case you don't understand how Moshi's screen protectors work: the only sticky part on them is where it covers the bezel-- the non-screen part of your device.)I also hate shiny screens and these protectors make devices usable which wouldn't work for me otherwise. So glad the anti-glare Moshi protector is available for the Fire Phone (for some other Amazon devices you can only get the regular Moshi screen protector).I've used this with the default Amazon cases without problem-- both the leather one and the polyurethane one. I just put the screen protector on first and then the case.","Moshi's screen protectors are so good, I choose my devices (in part) by whether they make them for them"
