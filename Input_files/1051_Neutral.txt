"Disappointing Kindle.Charging is sometimes interrupted by loss of connection between cover and Kindle. Complained and they sent me another cover. It works better, but still looses connectivity from time to time. Have to stop and disconnect cover and reconnect it. That usually stops the problem for a while.Also, It is not clear from the sales materials that the Premium Leather cover is suede. it shows scratches from fingernails.On the plus side, the Oasis screen is good and the quality of the text is excellent. Lighting is even and reading is easy on this device.","Good reader, but connection problems."
