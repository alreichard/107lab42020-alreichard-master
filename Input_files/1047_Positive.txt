"So far, this is doing what I wanted it to. I purchased it for having Alex hear me from my bedroom and my dining room. At times when I am playing music louder or just wanting her to do a command, I have to repeat myself louder. I usually keep the remote in the bedroom to give her commands but I will move it when I have company and am sitting down to eat or with guests in living room. I can practically whisper the command using the remote whereas without it, I have to shout the command out to the other room. Also, did not find opening the back to insert batteries that difficult. Did take a few tries to pair it. I ended up replacing the batteries that were sent with Duracell",Awesome - served my purpose.
