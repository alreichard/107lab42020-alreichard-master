"My remote went out just a couple weeks after we received the Fire Stick.Put new batteries in it and it worked another couple weeks. Then, I didn't have time to get to it until the return time was out. I tried batteries again, cleaning the ports, and everything I could think of. Because I can't get the cheap remote working, this Fire Stick is STUCK on the television on which is was originally installed.... until I pay for a new remote. Amazon, you can do better than this. I see that there are many, many posts of people like me whose remotes just don't work. A phone app is nice, but shouldn't HAVE to be the only answer besides another remote that costs 30 of the original whole product.",Shouldn't have to settle for a Phone App or paying 30 of the entire thing to get another remote. Shame on you Amazon!
