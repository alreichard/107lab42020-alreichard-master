"Easy to install screen protector, no bubbles. Fits just right on Fire phone. Will not disrupt most cases or change overall phone dimensions. Great item if you are letting your kid/grandkids use or play with your phone. This item will not disrupt the dynamic perspective or front facing cameras. Very good anti-glare properties, can notice a large difference.","Great screen protector, no bubble, great for kids"
