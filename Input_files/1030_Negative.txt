"UPDATE: July 6, 2015I'm reducing my rating to one star because all of a sudden this morning the screen protector just quit adhering to the screen. It falls off completely and if you do get it in place within five minutes it's slipping again and huge bubbles form. I have never had a problem with a Moshi product before and I am very surprised by this. At this price there is no excuse for the poor longevity of this product and I would never ever buy one again nor would I advise anybody to spend the money on this product to begin with.Original review follows in all its irony except for the whining about the price at the time that I still stand by:Superb screen protector. The best you can buy. Ridiculous price. Moshi products have been the stress reliever I've relied on when it comes to tablets and phone screen saver installation with their bubble proof installation and performance, but in this particular case I think the price I paid was twice what it was worth. So now the stress is back.",Updated Downgrade
