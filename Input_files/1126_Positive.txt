"(The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more",I would say these are the 'go-to' headphones for everyday use 342 people found this helpful.
