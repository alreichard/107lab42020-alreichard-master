So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all,Amazing Speaker
