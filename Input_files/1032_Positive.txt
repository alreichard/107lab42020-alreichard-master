"Finally a protector that works on the fire Phone. It is as advertised. Probably the easiest one I have put on (I have put screen protectors on several phones and tablets). No bubbles. But the best part is that this one actually works on the fire phone. This is the third screen protector I have tried. The first one was Glazz temper glass (this is when I found out about the issue with the sensors on the phone, you cannot cover them if you want the phone to work properly per Mayday). The second one was Mr Shield for the Fire Phone. Although the illustration showed cut outs for 4 of the 5 sensors, what was shipped had no cut outs for the sensors. The Yoshi has 5 cut outs for the sensors. Though it is a little pricey, it was well worth the money. MAYDAY was very helpful in finally getting me to this protector",Only one I have found to work on the Fire Phone
