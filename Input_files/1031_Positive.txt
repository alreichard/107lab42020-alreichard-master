It was easy to put on and line up.Had a hair in it and had to take it of and re-clean.No problem getting it off and back on again. It did not loose stickiness.NO bubbles is correct.I don't think it helps with the glare.The screen does look a little duller but I still have problems seeing it in daylight.I think it is one of the better screen protectors out there.,Screen Protector
