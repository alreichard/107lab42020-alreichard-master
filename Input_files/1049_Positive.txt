"Originally got the walnut cover with my Oasis. It's very nice, and I would describe it as a suede material. For me, the walnut cover didn't age well. Lots of scratching, which is' necessarily a bad thing, but it also seemed to darken a bit which made it a bit dirty. The merlot cover is also very nice and ages a whole lot better. After some months of use, it looks as good today as when I first bought it. Oasis covers in general are very functional. The 2nd battery in the cover is genius. Since I found I really like reading my Oasis without the cover, I love the easy on/off design of the case.",Beautiful and Functional
