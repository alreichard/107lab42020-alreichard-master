"I already own the Amazon Echo, so for smart speaker, it is one of the most handy devices out there. There is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing. Since the software update that allows you to use ""Always On"" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using ""Always On"" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere",Great Device Made better with Sofware Update
