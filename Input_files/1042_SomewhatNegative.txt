"As good as the Echo is, the Echo Voice Remote seems to leave much to be desired. Whereas the Echo Dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently, the Voice Remote is far less likely to do so. Sometimes I'm not even heard at all.

Since you can't see the LEDs on the Echo respond to the wake word, the Echo makes a tone to let you know that it's listening.

The Echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question.Read more","Has Trouble Understanding Commands, Volume Control Slow to Respond"
