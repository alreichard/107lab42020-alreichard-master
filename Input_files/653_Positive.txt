"I bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening. She had a huuuge portable speaker that didn't sound very good and used many double 'd' batteries. This one sounds better and lasts all day. I was concerned she wouldn't be able to figure it out, but it is so user friendly she has no issues with it. She loves it and that is a good thing.",Mother-In-Law Christmas gift success
