Remote is a great addition......I Have two echo's and two dots which I use for my home automation. They work great. My only issue is that Amazon is no longer shipping the magnetic holder with the Echo. Felt this was a very helpful and welcomed addition which helped me organize my remotes safely. This is the only reason I am giving it 3 stars.....C'mon Amazon you are charging the same price as the older remotes labelling it new generation and eliminating the magnetic holder......disappointing,Remote is a great addition.
