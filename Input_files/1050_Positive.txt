"The case that came with my Oasis had an edge that wasn't quite glued down. Amazon replaced it without difficulty and the new case is flawless.It detaches from the Oasis quickly and easily. I pull the Kindle off when I'm holding it one-handed and pop it right back in when finished.My only complain, which is a minor one, is that the felt inside cover can collect dust and dirt. But I don't know that there's a better way to construct it since the interior needs to be soft when it rests against the screen.In any case, it's a brilliant bit of kit, and I would buy another in an instant were anything to happen to the one I have now.",Replacement cover from Amazon under warranty
