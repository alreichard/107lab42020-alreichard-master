"Edit 6/15/17 After three months of use, I still don't love it. It works well, no complaints, but it marks up easily and the sides began flaking off. My original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back. I was much more careful with the merlot, and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time. And the flaky thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap. And for 90, I would expect real leather. So I switched back to my original black cover and I'm just letting it age with the device. I guess the plus side is that the merlot made me like the black cover more, but the downside is it cost 90 to do so. Ridiculous.As stated in the title, I love my Oasis. I've had it for about six months and, with the exception of the defective first one I received which was promptly replaced, I haven't had a problem out of it. I had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice, always. However, a couple of months ago I had gotten a screen protector and skin for the Oasis, and I just wasn't feeling the black cover anymore. I had considered the merlot (I think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch, but I despise brown leather) so I gave in after much consideration and ordered it. It didn't arrive with the bundle of things that it was supposedly shipped with, but after a quick call to customer service I had a new tracking number. It finally arrived today. I am disappointed to say that I don't love it. It smells funny, as I done remember my original doing. The color is duller than in the picture. Maybe my expectations had overblown due to the wait and the whole two tracking numbers thing, but I just don't love it.Read more","Love my Oasis. This cover, though Eh."
