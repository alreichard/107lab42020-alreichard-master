"Ordered on April 16th, installed on my phone on April 21 and last Saturday (June 6th) on a warm Tucson day it just fell off. Landed on the car mat an all of the glue section was instantly covered in dirt. Washed it off with cool water only, let air dry and it won't stick back on. It's supposed to be washable and re-usable. Don't waste your money on this piece of trash. I expected it to last a lot longer than two months.",Worked great... For less than two months. One person found this helpful.
