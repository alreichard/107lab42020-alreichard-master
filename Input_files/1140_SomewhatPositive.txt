Remote worked well for about 30 minutes but now jumps around several spots when using the up down left right buttons. I didn't really like using the phone app but will now have to go back to it.UPDATE: I was contacted by customer service and was advised to remove batteries and insert a fresh pair (although batteries were brand new to begin with) and to unplug the firestick to restart it. The remote has been working properly since doing this. I also used the same batteries. I just hope this isn't something that will need to be done frequently.,Disappointed - UPDATE
