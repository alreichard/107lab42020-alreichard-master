"Well what to say This is a replacement remote, did I buy it due to one not working Nope the kids lost it and I wanted another till I could find it. Paring it was simple, hold the home button for around 10-15 seconds to let the fire stick find it and then Boom your all set to go!Works just like the original that came with it so no worries there.",Great second remote
