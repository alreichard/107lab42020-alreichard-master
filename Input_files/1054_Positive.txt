"I replaced the brown suede cover that came with my Kindle because I'd dropped it a couple of times, and it had problems staying connected. It wouldn't charge so it was pretty much useless. I went with the leather cover because the suede cover, while nice to touch, did get worn(I had one on my old Kindle Paper White), so I decided a leather cover would be better. The color is as lovely as a glass of Merlot and stays connected so far. I love using this new Kindle Oasis because it's so much lighter than my old Paper White.",Great color One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No
