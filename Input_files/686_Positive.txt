"I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!",AMAZON TAP Best Portable Tech item of the Season!
