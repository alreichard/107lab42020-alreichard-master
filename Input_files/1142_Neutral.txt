"It blows my mind theres not a class action lawsuit against amazon for their crappy fire tv remotes. After mine died, like every other fire tv owner, i refused to buy the same crappy expensive remote only to have it die again. I found this cheaper option, it works just fine with the newer fire TV, it obviously doesnt have the alaxala voice command but i never used that anyway.",Decent replacement for something that shouldnt have had to be replaced
